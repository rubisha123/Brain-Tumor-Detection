# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies MRI images into two categories:
- Tumor
- No Tumor

It leverages deep learning to automate the detection process, improving early diagnosis and helping radiologists in clinical environments.
